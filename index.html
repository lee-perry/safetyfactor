		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On 23rd January 2023 the Fire Safety (England) Regulations 2022 come into force.  The Home Office has published its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-england-regulations-2022/fact-sheet-fire-doors-regulation-10">Fact Sheet</a> on the requirement for inpection of fire doors, including flat front-doors, in multi-occupant residential buildings taller than 11m.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The requirements require responsible persons, more about who they are in a later post, to undertake:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Quarterly checks of all fire doors to the common parts of these buildings.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> To use best endeavours to inspect all of the residential flat front door</li>
</ul>
<p>This presents responsible persons with two practical problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Content of fire door inspections, and competency of resource required</li>
<li>Access to the apartment side of residential front doors</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="fire-door-inspection">Fire Door Inspection</h3>
<p>Here the government sets out that it expects visual only checks that do not specialist resource, or tools.  However, it then sets out the content of the checks required - which really need both tools, as a minimum a simple gap testing gauge, and specialist knowledge! especially when applying the additional information in the guidance to regulations <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-england-regulations-2022-fire-door-guidance/fire-safety-england-regulations-2022-fire-door-guidance">here</a>.</p>
<p>As follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A responsible person should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>if there has been any alterations or damage to a doorâ€™s glazing apertures or air transfer grille</li>
<li>if there are any gaps around the door frame and that seals and hinges are fitted correctly</li>
<li>that the door closer shuts the door</li>
<li>that the door closes correctly around the whole frame</li>
<li>that there is no visible damage (either deliberate or from wear and tear) to the door or door closer</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="access">Access</h3>
<p>There will always be challenges in access to the residential side of flat front doors, given that residents may not be in, may be asleep, or may otherwise not wish to permit the flat-side of the door to be inspected.  In these circumstances the responsible person needs to record the efforts and communications made to be able to demonstrate that best endeavours have been made to inspect the door.</p>
