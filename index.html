			 <p>Building Risk Profiles are a fairly straightforward way of categorising buildings from a fire safety point of view, yet a concept that many fire risk assessor interviewees are surprisingly unfamiliar with.  This article provides an introduction to the concept.</p>
<h3 id="risk-profiles">Risk Profiles</h3>
<p>The building risk profile is a concept derived from <em>BS9999:2017 Fire safety in the design, management and use of buildings ‚Äì Code of practice</em>.</p>
<p>The risk profile is a composite of two factors, the type of occupancy, and the fire growth rate.  So a building with the risk profile A1 benefits from occupants who will be awake and familiar with the building, and limited combustible material, where one with C4 contains sleeping occupants and large bulk storage of combustible material (Note B4 and C4 are not acceptable under BS9999).</p>
<h6 id="table-4">Table 4</h6>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Note that according to 6.5 of BS9999 automatic sprinkler systems provide an efficient means of controlling fire within a compartment, and as such the fire growth rate can be lowered by one level in the sprinklered rooms.  This reduction should only be applied where the sprinkler system has been installed to BS EN 12845 (new) or BS 5306-2 (existing).</p>
<h3 id="why-are-building-risk-profiles-important">Why are building risk profiles important?</h3>
<p>When applying the principles of BS9999, buildings with higher risk profiles generally require lower levels of protection, can afford higher exit capacity, and support longer travel distances compared to buildings with lower risk profiles.  As such the building risk profile talks directly to level of control required when applying BS9999.</p>
<p>We will return to this principle in much more detail in later later articles.</p>

			 <p>This article describes how building legislation in England and Wales influences the fire safety of buildings in occupation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Building Act 1984 set out the framework for Building Regulations to be made, and for Documents to be Approved providing practical Guidance.  Approved Document B provides practical guidance on how to comply with the functional fire safety requirements set out in the Building Regulations 2010, which were made under the Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="building-act-1984">Building Act 1984</h2>
<p>The Building Act 1984 is the primary buildings legislation in England and Wales (Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own regimes which will be described separately).</p>
<p><strong>Section 1</strong> provides the Secretary of State with the powers to make regulations for the purposes of securing the safety of people in buildings with relation to the design, construction and demolition of buildings, and the services fittings and equipment provided in connection with buildings.</p>
<p>It is these powers that allow the government to set out building regulations, laying out the fire safety design requirements for buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Section 6</strong> provides the Secretary of State with the powers to approve documents providing practical guidance on the requirements set out in Building Regulations.  Though <strong>Section 7</strong> makes clear that failing to comply with an approved document is not in of itself an offence, but in proceedings would point towards liability, where compliance would point towards non-liability.  These presumptions change the emphasis - where the defender can show that the approved document was implemented, the pursuer or prosecutor must prove that the law was broken.  Where the approved document was not implemented, the defender must prove that it was not.</p>
<p><strong>Section 15</strong> Places a duty on the local authority to consult with the Fire and Rescue Authority prior to relaxing requirements set out in Building Regulations in relation to:</p>
<ul>
<li>structural fire precautions</li>
<li>means of escape</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="building-regulations-2010">Building Regulations 2010</h2>
<p>The Building Regulations 2010 are secondary instruments made under the Building Act 1984.  Regulation 4 requires <em>building work</em> to comply with <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2214/schedule/1/made">schedule 1</a>, while Regulation 6 requires material changes in use to conform to parts of schedule 1, including for fire safety purposes parts B1,B2,B3,B4(2) and B5.</p>
<p>Schedule 1 sets out the functional requirements for safety in buildings:</p>
<ul>
<li>B1 - Means of warning and escape</li>
<li>B2 - Internal fire spread (linings)</li>
<li>B3 - Internal fire spread (structure)</li>
<li>B4 - External fire spread</li>
<li>B4(2) - (roof only)</li>
<li>B5 - Access and facilities for the fire service.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="approved-document-b">Approved Document B</h2>
<p>The functional requirements set out in Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations are high level, goal setting objectives.</p>
<p>To provide a detailed means of achieving those objectives HM Government has published two volumes of Approved Document B which set out a design specification to comply with the functional requirements.
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b">Approved Document B (fire safety): Volume 1 - Dwellings</a>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b">Approved Document B (fire safety): Volume 2- Buildings other than dwellings</a></p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<ol>
<li>The requirement in respect of approved documents set out in Section 7 of the 1984 Act is to comply with the document at the time in force.  As such there is no requirement to improve the fire safety design of buildings as the specification strengthens within future editions of Approved Document B.</li>
<li>The law applies to new buildings, or to buildings when they undergo material change.  So again, unless there is a material change to a building, no requirement to upgrade the fire safety design is triggered.</li>
<li>For this reason a number of other guides and standards have been produced for the management of fire safety in buildings post-occupation, we will return to look at these in a subsequent article.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="degradation">Degradation</h2>
<p>Some proposed alterations to buildings will degrade or remove existing fire precautions.  According to Regulation 3 of the Building Regulations that alteration will be material, and therefore building work, if it causes B1,B3,B4,B5 (or part M, access) to be not complied with where it had been, or to be less complied with.</p>
<p>This is a significant protection - as it requires building notice and plans to be submitted for alterations that remove or degrade provisions under Regulation 12.</p>
<p>We hope that you found this explanation useful, please join the conversation below.</p>

		<a href="https://safetyfactor.co.uk/2023/01/25/210350.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-01-25 22:06:44 &#43;0000">Jan 25, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Coming into force on 23 January 2023, Regulation 4 of the Fire Safety (England) Regulations 2022 required responsible persons of high rise residential buildings to install secure property information boxes in or on their buildings, and to check it at least annually to ensure that the content remains up to date.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Premises information boxes serve to make building and apparatus information readily available to the fire and rescue service in the event of attendance to the building.  The box must contain the contact details for the responsible person, and <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2022/547/regulation/6/made">Regulation 6</a> specifies further what the box must contain:
[] Floor plans for each level within the building
[] A single page block plan identifying the building and environ, and the location of the firefighting features installed within.</p>
<p>The legislation implements recommendation 6 of the <a href="https://assets.grenfelltowerinquiry.org.uk/GTI%20-%20Phase%201%20full%20report%20-%20volume%204.pdf">Grenfell Tower Inquiry: Phase I Report</a> which was published in October 2019, and following which the Fire Industry Association (FIA) and National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) published the <a href="https://www.nationalfirechiefs.org.uk/write/MediaUploads/NFCC%20Guidance%20publications/Protection/PIBS_Guide_06-21_V2.pdf">Code of Practice for the Provision of Premises Information Boxes in Residential Buildings</a> in December 2020.  So though the legislation itself is new, building owners and managing agents will have been aware that this change was incoming for over 3 years.</p>
<p>The guidance actually goes further than the legislation, suggesting that the principles within are also relevant to smaller blocks with addition complexity, to mid rise accommodation 11-18m in height designed to accommodate a stay put policy, and also to new builds taller than 11m.</p>
<h2 id="location-of-premises-information-boxes">Location of Premises Information Boxes</h2>
<p>Premises Information boxes need to be installed where firefighters can readily access them in the event of an emergency, and in close proximity to any control equipment that may need to be operated.  So in determining the location of placement, consideration should be given to the point of access for the fire and rescue service, and of any firefighting controls.</p>
<p>The guidance suggests that a premises information box is required per block, however notes that for additional boxes may be required at larger more complex blocks with multiple access points.  It similarly identifies that for straightforward estates with multiple mid and low rise blocks, it my be possible to install a smaller number of boxes strategically placed at the access points for the fire and rescue service.</p>
<p>Finally, for staffed blocks, it is possible to position the box in the concierge&rsquo;s room - supported by way-finding signage for the fire and rescue service.</p>
<h2 id="security-of-premises-information-boxes">Security of Premises Information Boxes</h2>
<p>The premises information boxes should be secure, with access restricted to firefighters by a copy protected key, and provided to the Fire and Rescue Service.  This helps to ensure both that firefighters can access the box in the event of an emergency, and that the information remains within and has not been defaced.</p>
<h2 id="signage">Signage</h2>
<p>The position of the Premises Information Box should be demarked with a &ldquo;PIB for Fire and Rescue Service Use Only‚Äù firefighting equipment sign conforming to BS 5499-10.</p>
<h2 id="emergency-response-pack">Emergency Response Pack</h2>
<p>In addition to the building and orientation plans required in the legislation the code of practice suggests that the premises information box should be provided with details of specific fire safety issues in the building, a summary of the building evacuation strategy, and details of residents with mobility, cognitive or sensory impairments.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://safetyfactor.co.uk/2023/01/20/fire-door-inspection.html">Fire Door Inspection - Multi Occupancy Residential Buildings &gt; 11m</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://safetyfactor.co.uk/2023/01/20/fire-door-inspection.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-01-20 08:10:06 &#43;0000">Jan 20, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On 23rd January 2023 the Fire Safety (England) Regulations 2022 come into force.  The Home Office has published its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-england-regulations-2022/fact-sheet-fire-doors-regulation-10">Fact Sheet</a> on the requirement for inpection of fire doors, including flat front-doors, in multi-occupant residential buildings taller than 11m.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The requirements require responsible persons, more about who they are in a later post, to undertake:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Quarterly checks of all fire doors to the common parts of these buildings.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> To use best endeavours to inspect all of the residential flat front door</li>
</ul>
<p>This presents responsible persons with two practical problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Content of fire door inspections, and competency of resource required</li>
<li>Access to the apartment side of residential front doors</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="fire-door-inspection">Fire Door Inspection</h3>
<p>Here the government sets out that it expects visual only checks that do not specialist resource, or tools.  However, it then sets out the content of the checks required - which really need both tools, as a minimum a simple gap testing gauge, and specialist knowledge! especially when applying the additional information in the guidance to regulations <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-england-regulations-2022-fire-door-guidance/fire-safety-england-regulations-2022-fire-door-guidance">here</a>.</p>
<p>As follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A responsible person should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>if there has been any alterations or damage to a door‚Äôs glazing apertures or air transfer grille</li>
<li>if there are any gaps around the door frame and that seals and hinges are fitted correctly</li>
<li>that the door closer shuts the door</li>
<li>that the door closes correctly around the whole frame</li>
<li>that there is no visible damage (either deliberate or from wear and tear) to the door or door closer</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="access">Access</h3>
<p>There will always be challenges in access to the residential side of flat front doors, given that residents may not be in, may be asleep, or may otherwise not wish to permit the flat-side of the door to be inspected.  In these circumstances the responsible person needs to record the efforts and communications made to be able to demonstrate that best endeavours have been made to inspect the door.</p>
